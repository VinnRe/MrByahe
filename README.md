## Overview
	The Transportation Terminal Tracker is a C++ project designed to efficiently manage and track buses within a transportation terminal. The project provides a range of functionalities to assist in monitoring and organizing bus operations. One of its primary features is the display of the terminal map, providing a visual representation of the terminal layout and assisting staff in location specific buses and facilities. To effectively manage bus operations, the Transportation Terminal Tracker incorporates features for adding and departing buses. Connected to this, it has a departure history function for more efficient tracking, analysis of bus operations, and better management of resources within the terminal.
  The project also includes functionalities that records the boarding and disembarking of passengers onto specific buses, allowing for accurate passenger tracking. Additionally, it has functionalities that help retrieve important information regarding the buses and passengers. Terminal staff can use the system to obtain the passenger count for a specific bus, enabling them to gauge the occupancy level and make informed decisions. Furthermore, the system provides the total number of passengers across all buses, facilitating an overview of the terminal's overall passenger load. The project also identifies buses with the maximum number of passengers, aiding staff in identifying buses that may require additional resources or attention.
  Moreover, when displaying the bus details, the system assigns a color code to indicate its availability. Buses that are not yet full are labeled with a green color code, while fully occupied buses are marked in red, providing a visual cue for terminal staff. Moreover, the project utilizes linked lists and sorting algorithms to optimize data organization and retrieval, ensuring efficient performance throughout the system.

## Background and Motivation
  The Transportation Terminal Tracker is designed to streamline and enhance the efficiency of managing bus departures and passenger operations at a terminal. In bustling transportation hubs, effective management of departures and arrivals, passenger information, and terminal resources is crucial to ensure smooth operations and customer satisfaction. This project aims to provide a comprehensive solution, fulfilling the desire to replace traditional manual methods with a computerized solution that streamlines bus operations. 

  The motivation behind this project is to address the challenges faced by terminal operators and staff in efficiently managing the transportation operations. Traditionally, these tasks involve manual record-keeping, relying on paper-based systems, and visually assessing bus occupancy levels, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors. By creating a user-friendly and automated system, this project aims to simplify the process of tracking the arrivals and departures, and managing passenger information. The real-time visualization of the terminal map with color coding will also provide staff with an instant overview of bus occupancy levels, allowing them to make informed decisions. Ultimately, the Transportation Terminal Tracker seeks to improve operational efficiency, reduce errors, and enhance the overall passenger experience at the terminal.

## Objectives
	As to achieve a better overall transportation management through improving efficiency and enhancing commuter experience, the following are the objectives that encompasses the multiple dimensions of a terminal transportation management:
- Enhancing Fleet Management Operations
	Fleet management, which refers to the overall management of commercial motor vehicles, has been an essential operation for terminals. In order to be able to monitor real-time information crucial for fleet managers, such as the bus availability, parking lot occupancy, routes, etc. 
- Bus Occupancy Management
  As the terminal tracker is able to provide real-time data regarding the occupancy, it gives an opportunity for enabling seating reservations and identifying bus availability for the commuters. As we apply this management into real-life situations where the waiting time in public transportation is a huge issue, commuters would also be able to manage their time, as they would be notified if a bus with their desired route has arrived. Fleet managers would also be able to provide insights into passenger demand to ensure maximum utilization of bus capacity. 
- Commuter Information and Assistance
	Aside from the occupancy, several details regarding the bus type, which refers to if a certain bus has an air conditioning system or none, the list of bus routes, and the ticket fare can also be provided to the commuters through the tracker. Not only for the sake of awareness, but the information provided could be able to assist the commuters into managing their budget and comparing ticket prices with buses of the same routes.
- Infrastructure Management
	The terminal transportation tracker is able to provide maintenance or availability of the parking lot of the terminal. This feature would be able to assist the bus drivers into ensuring that the terminal has adequate parking space that could accommodate them.
- Data Analysis and Reporting
	The project includes the ability to view the history of the departure of the buses registered on the system. With this, the terminal and fleet companies would be able to analyze operational information. As they identify the areas that could be improved, they also would be able to create or modify significant changes to their management to achieve overall efficiency.

## Recommendations
	Mr. Byahe, a Terminal Transportation Tracker, can be further improved to create a more comprehensive management system. Multiple features can also be implemented such as: 
- Random Parking Slot Allocation,  which assigns available parking slots to buses in a random order, simulating real-world scenarios and avoiding biases or patterns. This feature ensures an equal distribution of buses, prevents congestion, and optimizes resource utilization in our bustling terminal transportation management system.
- Random Generation of Bus Information, which involves generating random attributes such as bus ID, destination, passenger capacity, arrival time, and departure time for each bus. By ensuring that this information is not repetitive or predictable, the system can provide a diverse and realistic representation of buses arriving at the terminal. This randomization enhances system testing, improves accuracy in passenger information, and contributes to an overall enhanced user experience.
- Real-time Departure Countdown and Simulation, which includes implementing a countdown timer for bus departures and simulating all the related processes, is a valuable recommendation for our terminal transportation management system. This feature enhances the system's functionality and provides a more immersive experience for both passengers and terminal operators.
Auto Replace of Bus, which implements an auto replace feature for every departed bus. This feature will automate the process of replacing a bus that has departed from the terminal, ensuring timely operations and minimizing downtime. Once a bus departs, the system will initiate a countdown timer based on the estimated arrival time of the replacement bus. The countdown timer will be displayed on the terminal map or user interface, providing real-time updates to terminal staff.
- Online ticketing system, which gives an opportunity to utilize online seat reservations and price checking including those who are granted discounts such as students, PWDs and senior citizens. 
- Real-time GPS tracker, which tracks the location of a certain bus going through its route. This would also be used by the fleet management, to be able to detect any accidents or emergencies and to be able to display its estimated time of arrival to the terminal for the commuters. This could also notify the commuters if a certain bus that theyâ€™re anticipating for is delayed according to the schedule.
- Multiple terminal station access, which would utilize a complex system that would be able to handle more than one terminal. This would also incorporate numerous buses, commuters, routes and managers. 
- Search route or destination feature, which would help the user to easily access available buses going through a specific route or compare ticket prices of multiple buses that would go through the same route. 
- Administrators and users accounts, which provides access levels within the system to be able to facilitate administrative control. With this feature, users would be able to oversee their history, previous time of departures and fares. It is also possible to be able to rate their commuting experience and ask for reviews, feedback and complaints.
